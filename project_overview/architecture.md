# Project Architecture Overview

## 1. Project Structure
The project is organized into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

- **active/**: Contains the main trading bot logic, including API interactions, trading strategies, and the trading interface.
- **backend/**: Houses backend services, including machine learning models and tests.
- **frontend/**: Contains the user interface components and related assets.
- **config/**: Configuration files for different environments (development, production, etc.).
- **deployment/**: Scripts and configurations for deploying the application.
- **docs/**: Documentation files, including setup guides and architecture details.
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests for various components of the project.

## 2. Key Components
- **Trading Engine**: Responsible for executing trades based on defined strategies.
- **API Handlers**: Interfaces with external trading platforms (e.g., Phemex) to fetch market data and execute trades.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Used for optimizing trading strategies and predicting market movements.
- **User Interface**: Provides a visual representation of trading data and allows users to interact with the trading bot.

## 3. Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language for backend services and trading logic.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Used for frontend development.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment across environments.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for model training and inference.

## 4. Communication Flow
- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful APIs.
- The backend interacts with external trading platforms through their respective APIs.
- Machine learning models are trained and evaluated within the backend, with results sent to the trading engine for decision-making.

## 5. Future Directions
- Integration of additional trading platforms.
- Enhancement of machine learning models for better prediction accuracy.
- User experience improvements in the frontend interface.

## 6. Deployment Strategy
- **Development Environment**: Use Docker Compose for local development to ensure consistency across different setups.
- **Staging Environment**: Deploy to a staging environment for testing and validation before production.
- **Production Environment**: Use Kubernetes for scalable and reliable deployment in production.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Implement CI/CD pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins to automate testing and deployment.
