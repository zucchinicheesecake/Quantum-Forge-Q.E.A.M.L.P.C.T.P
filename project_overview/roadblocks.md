# Project Roadblocks

## 1. Technical Challenges
- **API Limitations**: Encountered restrictions on the number of API calls to external trading platforms, leading to delays in data retrieval.
- **Data Quality**: Issues with the accuracy and completeness of market data, affecting trading decisions.

## 2. Development Hurdles
- **Integration Complexity**: Difficulty in integrating various components (frontend, backend, and machine learning models) due to differing technologies and frameworks.
- **Testing**: Challenges in creating comprehensive tests for the trading logic, especially under varying market conditions.

## 3. Resource Constraints
- Limited access to high-quality datasets for training machine learning models.
- Time constraints due to competing priorities and project deadlines.

## 4. Potential Solutions
- **API Limitations**: Implement caching mechanisms and optimize API call frequency.
- **Data Quality**: Use multiple data sources and implement data validation checks.
- **Integration Complexity**: Standardize communication protocols and use middleware for seamless integration.
- **Testing**: Develop a simulation environment to test trading logic under various market conditions.
- **Resource Constraints**: Seek partnerships for data access and allocate dedicated time for project development.
